Kenshin - Fake News Detector 

A powerful web page that detects fake news using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). Built with Flask, this tool enables users to input news content and get instant predictions on its authenticity.

 Features

-  Detects fake vs. real news using NLP and a trained ML model
-  Uses n-gram based feature extraction (TfidfVectorizer)
-  Flask-based web interface with clean UI
-  Organized project structure with static/templates folders

Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (via Flask templates)
- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, TfidfVectorizer, Multinomial Naive Bayes
- **Storage:** `.pkl` for model and vectorizer


Team & Contributions

This project was collaboratively developed by a team of passionate students.

### My Contributions
I was primarily responsible for the following:
- Designing and developing the **machine learning model** for fake news classification
- Implementing the **natural language processing (NLP)** pipeline using TfidfVectorizer and text preprocessing techniques
- Training and evaluating the model using **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
- Integrating the model with the Flask backend for real-time prediction
